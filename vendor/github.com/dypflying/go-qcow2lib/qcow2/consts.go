/*
 * Allocation status flags for bdrv_block_status() and friends.
 *
 * Public flags:
 * BDRV_BLOCK_DATA: allocation for data at offset is tied to this layer
 * BDRV_BLOCK_ZERO: offset reads as zero
 * BDRV_BLOCK_OFFSET_VALID: an associated offset exists for accessing raw data
 * BDRV_BLOCK_ALLOCATED: the content of the block is determined by this
 *                       layer rather than any backing, set by block layer
 * BDRV_BLOCK_EOF: the returned pnum covers through end of file for this
 *                 layer, set by block layer
 *
 * Internal flags:
 * BDRV_BLOCK_RAW: for use by passthrough drivers, such as raw, to request
 *                 that the block layer recompute the answer from the returned
 *                 BDS; must be accompanied by just BDRV_BLOCK_OFFSET_VALID.
 * BDRV_BLOCK_RECURSE: request that the block layer will recursively search for
 *                     zeroes in file child of current block node inside
 *                     returned region. Only valid together with both
 *                     BDRV_BLOCK_DATA and BDRV_BLOCK_OFFSET_VALID. Should not
 *                     appear with BDRV_BLOCK_ZERO.
 *
 * If BDRV_BLOCK_OFFSET_VALID is set, the map parameter represents the
 * host offset within the returned BDS that is allocated for the
 * corresponding raw guest data.  However, whether that offset
 * actually contains data also depends on BDRV_BLOCK_DATA, as follows:
 *
 * DATA ZERO OFFSET_VALID
 *  t    t        t       sectors read as zero, returned file is zero at offset
 *  t    f        t       sectors read as valid from file at offset
 *  f    t        t       sectors preallocated, read as zero, returned file not
 *                        necessarily zero at offset
 *  f    f        t       sectors preallocated but read from backing_hd,
 *                        returned file contains garbage at offset
 *  t    t        f       sectors preallocated, read as zero, unknown offset
 *  t    f        f       sectors read from unknown file or offset
 *  f    t        f       not allocated or unknown offset, read as zero
 *  f    f        f       not allocated or unknown offset, read from backing_hd
